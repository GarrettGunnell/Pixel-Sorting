# Pixel Sorting

by Acerola

for Unity 2021 Built-In Render Pipeline

## Disclaimer

This shader was an attempt at creating a real time pixel sorter without any faking. The pixel sorting is legitimate, but in the end, it is not very performant and if your game has a low performance budget then this effect is definitely not for you.
